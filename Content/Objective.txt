C# Practical test 
We need a windows service that will provide responses to a client. You can assume that the client is a basic text based IM. 
For the purposes of testing you can create a basic Winform or web client that uses the service.  
 
The service needs to take a text input provide a text response.  
 
It needs to provide a workflow and follow the following steps and maintain state of the client.  
1. Registration 
2. Opt in 
3. First Name  
4. Profiling 
5. Rewarding 
6. End

In the registration step the service must validate the registration based on one of two keywords: 
1. Cm1234 
2. Loyalty24 

A person must opt-in and an opt-in question for provide personal data, communication via sms, email and IM and participation in marketing activations. 
 
A question should be asked to obtain the First name.  
 
You should go into a profiling phase where a certain number of profile questions are askers (say 3 questions such as age, gender and province) 
 
Once the profile is complete the person may or may not receive a reward. Issuing of rewards should be randomised. 
 
Then there is an end state. 
 
The service should account for the broken connection from the client and pick up where left off.  
 
You can assume one client for now. 
 
We are looking for the following: 
1. Use of WCF 
2. Use of polymorphism in c# 
3. OO techniques 
4. Code clarity and an attempt to build for robustness
